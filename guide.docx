Guide contents (detailed)
1) Commercial model & pricing — how distributors make money
  - Fees you pay to Cotopia (Distributor costs)
    - One-time Admin Fee (per Product Agreement / per Product): covers partner onboarding, portal, initial marketing kit, training.
    - Continued License & Tech Support Fee: mandatory recurring fee paid every 90 days (initial $79 then $149 every 90 days).
    - Recruited Distributor flow: Distributor may collect Admin Fee from downstream distributors and keep it; Distributor must remit recruited distributor’s initial $79 to Cotopia within 5 business days.
  - Suggested reseller pricing strategies (examples)
    - Direct Resell (simple markup)
      - Cotopia list to Distributor (Tier 1 example): Admin $349 + initial $79 due = $428 first payment to Cotopia.
      - Suggested Distributor retail price to end Customer for first 90 days: $799 (example). Recurring 90-day retail: $249.
      - Gross margin example (first period): Retail $799 − (Distributor cost $428 + internal onboarding cost $100) = $271 gross margin.
    - Subscription / SaaS Add-on (monthlyized view)
      - Map Cotopia 90‑day cadence into monthly billing: initial $79 ≈ $26/mo (first 3 months), recurring $149/90 days ≈ $49.67/mo.
      - Example retail monthly price to customers: $69/mo (billed monthly) or $199/90 days billed in sync with Cotopia. Margin example: $69 − $49.67 = $19.33/mo pre-support costs.
    - Bundle + Service Upsell (recommended for VARs)
      - Offer integration, CSV SKU onboarding, product photography, packaging templates, on-site training.
      - Example bundle: App license + onboarding + small integration = $1,399 one-time + $299 per 90‑day support.
      - Reason: professional services often yield higher margins.
    - White‑label / OEM (Tier 4)
      - If authorized, set wholesale price with Cotopia (negotiated). Add markup and integrate into your platform pricing.
  - Examples for distributors recruiting downstream distributors
    - Distributor collects Admin Fee $349, keeps it; must remit recruited distributor’s initial $79 to Cotopia in 5 business days.
    - Distributor may charge recruited distributor a higher onboarding fee (e.g., $499) and keep difference as a finder fee, but must remit the $79.

2) Tier selection & what each tier includes (how to pick)
  - Tier 1 — Basic Reseller
    - Price: Admin $349 + Continued License $79 initial, then $149/90 days.
    - Best for: small resellers who resell “as‑is” without custom integrations or white‑labeling.
    - Rights: resell, bundle with services, Distributor-only tech support.
  - Tier 2 — VAR
    - Price: Admin $549 + same continued license cadence.
    - Best for: resellers delivering added services (integrations, training). Higher Admin justifies broader co‑branding and prioritized partner resources.
  - Tier 3 — Admin / Full-Service Reseller
    - Price: Admin $749 + same continued license cadence.
    - Best for: resellers offering onboarding/managed services at scale — includes more training and partner manager access.
  - Tier 4 — White‑label / OEM
    - Price: Admin $949+ or negotiated.
    - Best for: platform operators who want rebrand/own UX (requires explicit Product Agreement clause).
  - Picking tip: start Tier 1 or 2; move up when you need co-brand materials, higher SLAs or white‑label rights.

3) Onboarding checklist (step-by-step)
  Pre-signing (sales)
  - Identify Territory and Tier required for your market.
  - Prepare corporate documents and unique company name (DBA may not include “Cotopia”).
  - Choose support model for each Product Agreement: Distributor-as-Middleman (default) or Distributor-Handles-Direct.
  - Provide Product Agreement contact and billing information.
  Execution & initial payments
  - Pay Admin Fee for chosen Tier to Cotopia; pay initial 90-day $79.
  - If recruiting Recruited Distributor: collect Admin Fee (you may retain it) and remit recruited’s $79 + paperwork to Cotopia within five business days.
  Post-execution provisioning
  - Cotopia provides partner portal access, Documentation, marketing kit, onboarding training.
  - Complete company-specific onboarding in 5 days (per Exhibit A) to receive provisioning/license keys.
  Internal setup
  - Assign authorized support contacts who will receive Included Tech Support.
  - Train sales and technical staff on product features (see feature guide below).
  - Decide pricing, packaging and go-to-market messaging.

4) Operational responsibilities & compliance reminders
  - Sales & Reporting: submit required sales and activity reports (monthly or quarterly as per Product Agreement).
  - Taxes: you are responsible for VAT/GST/sales taxes on your invoices; Cotopia responsible for net income taxes.
  - Brand use: Cotopia Marks may be used only after timely payments and per brand guidelines; do not use “Cotopia” in DBA.
  - Support model compliance: follow elected support model; Cotopia provides Included Tech Support only to Distributor personnel unless otherwise stated.
  - Data privacy & DPA: if handling personal data for customers, execute DPA per Exhibit E where required.

5) Technical & product guide — app features, workflows and integration notes
  High-level app functions (quick)
  - Build tab: choose Mode (QR, SKU, QR+SKU), payload, embed file, SKU pattern, generate SKU, export PNG/SVG, prepare chunks and ZIP for large files.
  - Customize tab: size, colors, logo, error correction, style, margin, top label.
  - Scan tab: start camera scanner, upload images, detect QR, interpret manifests and SKUs.
  - Supports embedding small files into QR (<= ~6KB data URL), otherwise generate manifest + ZIP package with file + qr.png + manifest.json and allow download.
  - Chunking: create client-side chunked ZIP for large files for progressive uploads / staged delivery.
  - CSV SKU import: upload CSV of SKUs (one SKU per line or column), pick/use SKUs from imported list.
  - Templates: vCard, URL, JSON payload templates.
  - Persistence: localStorage saves settings, logo, SKU list and last SKU.

  Detailed feature walkthrough (for reseller training materials)
  - Generating a QR with embedded small file
    1. Build → choose Mode (e.g., both).
    2. Paste payload or select template.
    3. Attach file ≤6KB. App will base64 embed file into QR payload.
    4. Customize → set colors, logo and margin; generate.
    5. Export PNG/SVG or copy payload to use in systems.
    - Integration note: embedding binary increases QR complexity; recommend using the manifest/ZIP flow for files >6KB.

  - Generating manifest + downloadable package (recommended for distributors)
    1. Attach large file in Build tab.
    2. Generate: app will compute SHA‑256 and include manifest in QR payload.
    3. Download package (ZIP) includes original file, qr.png and manifest.json.
    4. For distribution: host ZIP on your server or provide direct download link in your invoicing/portal and use QR only for verifying manifest.
    - Security/Trust: manifest contains SHA‑256 so customers can verify integrity of file after download.

  - Chunking / progressive delivery (use case: large catalogs, offline devices)
    1. Choose chunk size (default 262,144 bytes ≈ 256KB).
    2. Click Prepare Chunks: client prepares part files (.part001, .part002…) and manifest.json and bundles as ZIP.
    3. Upload parts to your storage or CDN; share download instructions with customers.
    - Implementation tip: on the receiving side, provide a small script to reassemble parts and verify SHA‑256.

  - CSV SKU import & workflow
    1. Create CSV with a single column of SKUs (or SKUs in first column).
    2. Import via CSV SKU Import control; app parses first column into the SKU list.
    3. Use SKU list entries to populate SKU label region or cycle through SKUs when generating QR + SKU.
    - Business usage: useful for distributors onboarding thousands of SKUs for customers (e.g., wholesalers, manufacturers).

  - Integration patterns for marketplaces/platforms
    - Option A — Embedded widget
      - Add single-file HTML to a hosted location and embed via iframe on product pages.
      - Use Product Agreement to give customers access; you control hosting, branding and access.
    - Option B — API + Server packaging
      - Use the client app to build QR + manifest, then server-side code generates final ZIP packages, stores on your server/CDN and populates product pages with download links.
    - Option C — White‑label provisioning (Tier 4)
      - With Product Agreement permissions, rebrand app and integrate into Admin dashboard; offer as part of SaaS subscription.

6) Technical onboarding checklist (for your tech team)
  - Confirm JavaScript dependencies are accessible (cdn.jsdelivr links included).
  - Host single-file HTML on your secure web server (HTTPS required for camera access).
  - Test camera scanning across target devices (iOS Safari, Android Chrome, desktop browsers).
  - Implement server-side artifact hosting and SHA‑256 verification (manifest verification).
  - Provide a script or microservice for reassembly of chunked files (if using chunking).
  - Ensure CORS and content-disposition headers are correct when serving ZIPs.

7) Go‑to‑market materials & recommended sales messaging
  - Core value props for distributors to highlight:
    - Fast, portable QR + SKU creation with SKU label band for printed packaging.
    - Embed small product files directly in QR or provide secure manifest + downloadable package for larger files.
    - Batch SKU import, CSV support and chunked file packaging for large catalogs.
    - Camera-based scanning and verification experience for customers and field teams.
    - Easy customization (colors, logos, label) for brand consistency.
  - Suggested sales bundles & pricing examples
    - Starter Pack (Target: small retailers)
      - Offer: Annual subscription (billed every 90 days) + basic onboarding.
      - Price example: $199 initial + $149 every 90 days. Includes 1-hour integration / training.
    - VAR Pack (Target: resellers + integrators)
      - Offer: License + 8 hours of integration + CSV onboarding + custom packaging.
      - Price example: $1,399 one-time + $299 every 90 days for ongoing support.
    - Enterprise Pack (Target: marketplaces / distributors)
      - Offer: White‑label (if authorized), bulk SKU onboarding, custom integrations, SLA.
      - Price example: negotiated (e.g., $5,000 onboarding + $999 every 90 days).
  - Sales collateral suggestions
    - One-page PDF “How it works” for customers (diagram: app → QR → scan → manifest verification).
    - Case study showing time savings for a distributor who onboarded 10k SKUs (include metrics).
    - FAQ for customers on manifest/ZIP verification and security.

8) Support model & escalation (what distributor must provide vs Cotopia)
  - Distributor-as-Middleman (default)
    - Distributor provides first-line support to Customers.
    - Distributor uses Included Tech Support for triage and escalations to Cotopia.
    - Cotopia responds to Distributor support tickets per target SLA (acknowledgement targets).
  - Distributor-Handles-Direct
    - Distributor handles support, may not escalate unless a SOW authorizes customer-facing support from Cotopia.
  - Recommended internal runbook for Distributor support
    - Tier 1: common fixes (regenerate QR, re-upload logo, change colors, re-download package) — Distributor resolves.
    - Tier 2: manifest mismatch, file packaging issues — gather logs, reproduce and escalate to Cotopia with sha256, sample file and reproduction steps.
    - Tier 3: security or production incidents — immediate escalation to Cotopia per Exhibit B (follow emergency procedure).
  - Recordkeeping & reporting
    - Keep ticket logs, customers impacted, actions taken and remediations for audit.

9) Legal & compliance checklist (must-dos)
  - Use Cotopia Marks only per Agreement and brand guidelines; suspend use if fees unpaid.
  - Do not alter product core code unless Agreement explicitly allows and sets terms.
  - Maintain required insurance and follow export control rules.
  - Remit recruited distributors’ initial $79 and paperwork in 5 business days where applicable.
  - Ensure data protection compliance; execute DPA where processing personal data.
  - Preserve Confidential Information and comply with audit obligations.

10) Example customer scenarios — how distributors should sell & deliver
  - Scenario A: Local distributor sells to small retail chain
    - Pricing: Offer $799 for first 90 days + $249/90 days thereafter.
    - Delivery: Host app on reseller site, provide CSV SKU onboarding, produce ZIP packages for large catalogs.
    - Support: Distributor provides training and troubleshooting; escalate platform bugs to Cotopia.
  - Scenario B: Marketplace integrates QR generator into seller dashboard
    - Pricing: Marketplace bundles license into seller subscription, charges sellers $10/month extra.
    - Delivery: White‑label integration (if authorized) or iframe embed; marketplace provides hosting and single-sign-on to sellers.
    - Support: Marketplace handles seller support; escalations go to Cotopia for product bugs.
  - Scenario C: Manufacturer distributes packaged product files to field agents
    - Workflow: Manufacturer uses chunking to split big training videos, hosts parts on CDN; field app reassembles and verifies SHA‑256.
    - Pricing: One-time license + professional services to implement reassembly.
    - Support: Distributor/VAR provides reassembly utility and first-line support.

11) Sample financial model (simple, per one Product Agreement)
  - Assumptions:
    - Tier 2 Admin Fee to Cotopia: $549 (Distributor pays).
    - Continued License & Tech Fee: $79 initial, $149/90 days recurring.
    - Distributor lists product at $799 first 90 days, $249 every 90 days after.
    - Distributor charges $300 one-time onboarding services.
  - First 90 days revenue & cost (per customer)
    - Revenue: $799 (license) + $300 (services) = $1,099.
    - Costs to Cotopia: $549 Admin + $79 initial = $628.
    - Gross margin (90 days): $1,099 − $628 = $471 (before Distributor operational costs).
  - Ongoing 90-day periods
    - Revenue: $249 (license recurring).
    - Cost: $149 (to Cotopia every 90 days).
    - Gross margin per 90 days: $100 (before support and operations).
  - Notes:
    - Scale improves margins when amortizing onboarding costs.
    - Upsell professional services (CSV import, integration) greatly increases the effective margin.

12) Marketing & partner enablement assets (recommended)
  - Required assets from Cotopia (to request)
    - Partner portal access, logos, brand guidelines, product screenshots, templated one‑pagers, integration snippets, and sample manifests + verification scripts.
  - Distributor-created assets (recommended)
    - Landing page describing benefits and pricing plans.
    - How-to video showing QR creation, embedding a file, chunking workflow and scanning.
    - “Get started” kit: quick-start PDF + CSV template + reassembly script for chunked files.
    - Email templates (onboarding, license renewal reminders, recruited distributor onboarding instructions).
  - Co-marketing
    - Coordinate with Cotopia for joint webinars, case studies, or partner listings (Company may list Distributor on partner page unless Distributor opts out).

13) Operational examples & scripts (practical tips)
  - Reassembly script outline (pseudo)
    - Keep manifest.json with parts list + sha256.
    - Download parts in order, append bytes, verify final SHA‑256 matches manifest.
    - Offer a cross-platform small JS utility or CLI (Node) to reassemble parts for customers.
  - Host ZIPs securely
    - Set Content-Disposition to attachment; ensure HTTPS; set cache and CORS as appropriate.
  - Automate documentation delivery
    - After contract signing, send an onboarding packet with required items and a checklist.
  - Verification tooling
    - Provide customers a simple SHA‑256 checksum web tool to paste hex and verify file integrity (or include verification script in ZIP).

14) Risks & mitigations (commercial and technical)
  - Risk: Underpricing relative to recurring costs
    - Mitigation: Ensure pricing covers recurring $149/90 days; map to monthly billing to see true cost.
  - Risk: Improper use of Cotopia Marks / branding errors
    - Mitigation: enforce internal brand use policy and require Cotopia approval for co-branded materials.
  - Risk: Recruited Distributor nonpayment or paperwork delay
    - Mitigation: collect Admin Fee and initial $79 at onboarding, remit within 5 business days, keep documentation.
  - Risk: Customers expect direct Cotopia support
    - Mitigation: clarify support model in customer agreements and on sales pages; offer paid white-glove support SOWs if needed.
  - Risk: Large file distribution complexity
    - Mitigation: use chunking & hosted packages; include manifest and verification steps; provide reassembly tool.

15) Templates & documents you should maintain
  - Sales quote template (showing first 90-day costs and ongoing cadence).
  - Onboarding packet including Exhibit F (Recruited Distributor Onboarding & Remittance Form).
  - Customer-facing Quick Start and Acceptable Use Policy (to manage expectations).
  - Internal escalation matrix mapping Distributor tiers to Cotopia support contacts and severity levels.

16) Next steps checklist (for a Distributor evaluating Cotopia)
  - Decide Tier and support model; sign Product Agreement.
  - Pay Admin Fee and initial Continued License Fee.
  - Provision partner team (sales, tech, support).
  - Host or embed the Cotopia app and test end-to-end (generate QR, embed file, large file manifest + ZIP, chunking + reassembly).
  - Create pricing & bundle offers; prepare sales collateral and onboarding materials.
  - Start pilot with one or two customers; measure cost-to-serve and refine pricing.
  - Scale to larger customers and consider moving to a higher Tier if needed.

Appendix — quick reference of fees & examples
- Admin / Enrollment Fee: Tier 1 $349 | Tier 2 $549 | Tier 3 $749 | Tier 4 $949+ (one-time). Distributor may collect Admin Fee from Recruited Distributors and retain it (but must remit recruited’s $79).
- Continued License & Tech Support Fee: initial $79 (due on execution), then $149 every 90 days (mandatory).
- Example reseller retail first 90-day price: $799 (you set this). Ongoing 90-day price example: $249.
