Scope
-----
These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your access to and use of the Cotopia QR & SKU Maker / Scanner web application and related services (the "App" or "Service") provided by Cotopia, a Wyoming corporation with principal place of business at 30 Gould St Ste R, Sheridan, WY 82801 ("Cotopia", "we", "us" or "Company"). By accessing or using the App you agree to be bound by these Terms and any Product Agreement, Order Form or Partner Agreement by which you access the App. If you are accepting these Terms on behalf of a business or organization, you represent that you have authority to bind that entity. If you do not have such authority, or you do not agree, do not use the App.

1. Definitions
--------------
Capitalized terms used in these Terms have the meanings set forth in the Distribution / Reseller Licensing and Partnership Agreement where applicable. Additional definitions for these Terms:

- **Distributor** — an entity that resells, integrates, or distributes the App under a Product Agreement with Cotopia.  
- **Customer** — an end user or purchaser of the App or services from a Distributor.  
- **Documentation** — user guides, integration instructions, partner materials and other written materials Cotopia provides.

2. License & Access
-------------------
Subject to your compliance with these Terms and any applicable Product Agreement, Cotopia grants you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable (except as permitted by a Product Agreement), revocable license to use the App in object-code form for your internal business purposes or to resell/redistribute the App consistent with a Product Agreement. Unless expressly permitted by a Product Agreement, no right to access App source code, rehost Cotopia’s production SaaS, or to white‑label the App is granted.

3. Account, Payment & Fees
--------------------------
- **Account registration.** You must create an account and provide accurate information. You are responsible for activity on your account and for maintaining the confidentiality of credentials.  
- **Fees & billing.** Use of the App is subject to Admin Fees and Continued License & Tech Support Fees as set out in the Product Agreement and Master Agreement. Cotopia invoices or charges per the Product Agreement; Distributor obligations to remit recruited-distributor fees are described in the Master Agreement.  
- **Non-payment.** Cotopia may suspend or terminate access for unpaid fees, and may charge interest on past-due amounts as provided in the Product Agreement.

4. Use Restrictions
-------------------
You must not:

- Remove or alter Cotopia’s proprietary notices;  
- Reverse engineer or attempt to extract source code except as permitted by law;  
- Use the App to create or distribute unlawful content;  
- Use Cotopia Marks or claim endorsement beyond the scope permitted by your Product Agreement;  
- Export or re-export the App to embargoed or sanctioned regions or persons.

5. Distributor & Customer Obligations
------------------------------------
- **Distributor obligations.** Distributors must comply with the Master Agreement: maintain competent staff, perform required onboarding, comply with export controls, and follow the elected support model (Distributor-as-Middleman or Distributor‑Handles‑Direct).  
- **Customer-facing use.** Distributors must not represent Cotopia’s support or SLAs to Customers beyond what is agreed in a Product Agreement or SOW.

6. Support, Updates & Maintenance
---------------------------------
Cotopia provides Included Tech Support to Distributor personnel as described in the Product Agreement. Cotopia may provide updates, patches and new features. Cotopia is not required to provide support directly to Customers unless an explicit Product Agreement or SOW provides otherwise. Cotopia may schedule maintenance and will use commercially reasonable efforts to notify affected partners in advance.

7. Privacy & Data
-----------------
Cotopia's Privacy Policy describes how we collect and process personal data. Distributors are responsible for their Customer data processing and for obtaining consents where required. If Cotopia processes personal data on your behalf, the Parties will execute a Data Processing Addendum (DPA). Cotopia will treat data submitted through the App in accordance with the Privacy Policy and DPA (if applicable).

8. Intellectual Property
------------------------
Cotopia retains all rights, title and interest in the App, Documentation, Cotopia Marks and other IP. Distributor and Customers acquire only the license rights expressly granted. Feedback you provide may be used by Cotopia without obligation.

9. Security & Acceptable Use
----------------------------
- **Security practices.** Cotopia implements reasonable technical and organizational measures for the App. Distributors must maintain appropriate security practices for credentials and Customer data, promptly report security incidents to Cotopia, and comply with Company partner security requirements.  
- **Acceptable use.** You must not use the App to violate laws, transmit malware, or infringe third-party rights. Cotopia reserves the right to suspend accounts that threaten security, cause degradation, or are used for abuse.

10. Warranties & Disclaimers
----------------------------
Cotopia warrants that it has the right to grant the license and that the App will materially conform to Documentation. EXCEPT FOR THE EXPRESS WARRANTY ABOVE, THE APP IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND COTOPIA DISCLAIMS ALL OTHER WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.

11. Indemnity
-------------
Each Party will indemnify the other for third-party claims as set forth in the Master Agreement. In particular, Distributor indemnifies Cotopia for claims arising from Distributor's breach, customer-facing promises beyond Company obligations, or Distributor modifications to the App.

12. Limitation of Liability
---------------------------
TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, NEITHER PARTY WILL BE LIABLE TO THE OTHER FOR INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES (INCLUDING LOST PROFITS). COTOPIA'S AGGREGATE LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THESE TERMS SHALL NOT EXCEED THE AMOUNTS PAID BY DISTRIBUTOR TO COTOPIA FOR THE AFFECTED PRODUCT DURING THE TWELVE (12) MONTHS PRIOR TO THE CLAIM, OR $500 IF NO AMOUNTS WERE PAID.

13. Termination & Suspension
----------------------------
- **For cause.** Cotopia may suspend or terminate access upon material breach (including nonpayment) if not cured within applicable cure periods. Cotopia may also suspend for security incidents or legal obligations.  
- **Effects.** Upon termination you must cease use of the App and Cotopia Marks, return or destroy Confidential Information, and remain liable for accrued fees. Certain obligations survive termination (confidentiality, indemnity, IP, payment and limitation of liability).

14. Export Compliance
---------------------
You must comply with all applicable export and sanctions laws. You may not download, export, re-export, or transfer the App to embargoed or sanctioned countries or prohibited persons.

15. Changes to Terms
--------------------
Cotopia may update these Terms to reflect changes in law, the service, or business practices. For material changes, Cotopia will provide notice in advance where practicable. Continued use of the App after notice constitutes acceptance of modified Terms.

16. Governing Law & Dispute Resolution
-------------------------------------
These Terms and any Product Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of Wyoming without regard to conflict-of-law rules. The Parties will attempt amicable resolution for 30 days; unresolved disputes will be litigated in state or federal courts located in Wyoming (exclusive venue), subject to injunctive relief rights.

17. Additional Terms for Distributors
------------------------------------
- **Partner terms prevail.** Distributor engagements are also governed by the Distribution / Reseller Licensing and Partnership Agreement and Product Agreement. In case of conflict, the Product Agreement controls for the applicable Product.  
- **Recruitment & remittance.** If you recruit downstream distributors you must follow the onboarding and remittance rules in the Master Agreement (including remitting each recruited distributor’s initial $79 within five business days and providing required paperwork).  
- **Trademark use.** Use of Cotopia Marks is conditioned on timely payment and compliance with brand guidelines. Cotopia may suspend trademark rights for non-payment or misuse.

18. Third-Party Services & Open Source
-------------------------------------
The App may incorporate third-party services, SDKs or open-source components under separate licenses. You agree to comply with such third-party licenses. Cotopia is not liable for third-party services.

19. Miscellaneous
-----------------
- **Entire agreement.** These Terms, Product Agreements, DPAs and exhibits constitute the entire agreement between you and Cotopia regarding the App.  
- **Severability.** If a provision is unenforceable, the remainder remains in effect.
